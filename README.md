# Isoform spesific PI3K inhibitor analysis
This project includes the files and codes used in my doctoral thesis project named as "A systems network approach for differential responses of Cancer Cells toward PI3K isoform Inhibitors". 

A global study model comprising two HCC cell lines; Huh7 and Mahlavu, treated with kinase inhibitors; Sorafenib and PI3K inhibitors respectively; PI3K-α (PIK-75), PI3K-β (TGX-221), and combinations of Sorafenib with PI3K; Sorafenib + PI3Ki-α and Sorafenib + PI3Ki- β and DMSO as negative control. Therefore, for RNA-seq experiment, cDNA libraries prepared from 2 cell lines per 5 treatments and 1 control for each in total 12 samples.  FASTQ reads of them can be found https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/PRJNA556552 when this study published.
